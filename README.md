 Java - OOPs, DSA & Problem-Solving By Wipro Talent Next Program for Students.

This repository contains my solutions to Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and Logic-Building problems from the Wipro TalentNext - Java Full Stack Development course (May – September 2024).
📌 Topics Covered:

✔️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) – Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
✔️ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming
✔️ Problem-Solving – Real-world coding challenges to strengthen logic-building skills

This repository is a valuable resource for Java learners looking to master OOPs, DSA, and efficient problem-solving techniques.
